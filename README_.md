# Libft

In this project I writed the code of more than 40 functions, including standard functions of libc.
Added to this, I created a ".h" file and a Makefile so it makes easy to compile and create a libft.a file.

The goal of this all is being familiarized with a lot of different functions, understand how they works and be able to understando how the memory is manipulated.

Also it helps me to call functions in the next 42 projects, instead of write the function all the time.
